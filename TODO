GENERAL
* man page from help
* bash/zsh completion
* provide vim syntax highlight?.... really?
* add tests!

ISSUES
* profile speed things
* script executable injection checking
* investigate why some symbols can't be satisfied USB_DVB_V2 e.g.

FEATURES
* diff command (two external configs?)
* search for symbol?
* out of tree builds, as another user. with config backcopy to silence portage
  - out_of_tree true;
  - user u;
  - group g;
* keep old by version or date (e.g. last 2 w and last major version)
* trailing conditions else form
* (really good idea?) issue warning when try set is used but the value is not pinned afterwards in the same module.
